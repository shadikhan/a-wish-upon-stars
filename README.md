Objectives: _Create a wish list app with a React frontend, Node.js & Express backend, and Mongoose to communicate with a MongoDB database._

## Development Setup & Notable Dependencies

In the:

- implementation
- implementation/backend
- implementation/frontend

folders, run <code>npm install</code>. This will install all the necessary dependencies in your application.

To start up the app, simply run <code>npm start</code> in the implementation directory, or in either the
backend or frontend folder to launch that respective portion of the app.

There are a couple of external dependencies that are used extensively within this app:

1. react-bootstrap – Component library based on popular frontend library Bootstrap
2. react-ratings-declarative – Star Ratings Component
3. axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js
